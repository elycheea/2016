### Team T-Shirts

While attending a Swift developer conference, a team member requested a “snazzy
team shirt” to explain our product.

I quickly got to work on his request. Unfortunately, we did not send the shirts
to print. Yet.

### Birthdays

For an upcoming birthday celebration, a friend _strongly encouraged_ me to make
a program for the girls’ day out. I, of course, obliged.
